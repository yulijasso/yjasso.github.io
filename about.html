            <p>
            
            
                Greetings! I'm Yuliana Denisse Jasso, a dedicated Computer Scientist on a journey shaped by unique experiences and unyielding passion.

                <br>                <br>

                My academic voyage commenced in an unexpected realm - I embarked on my undergraduate studies as a major in Computer Information Systems within the Business School. Immersed in the intricacies of business, I delved into marketing strategies, business plans, and the art of HR management. Yet, it was the pivotal moment when I ventured into my core major classes of Computer Information Systems that my trajectory shifted. Introducing myself to the realm of programming through my first class, "Intro to Business Programming," I was captivated. However, my disappointment ensued upon realizing it stood as the sole programming course within the CIS curriculum.
                
                It was in this juncture that the realization dawned upon me - to align my academic pursuit with my true passion: Computer Science. Driven by an unwavering fervor, I embraced the challenge, even if it meant delaying my graduation. The allure of Computer Science was magnetic, igniting a spark within me unlike any before. With each passing day, my dedication reflected in my academic performance, reaffirming the adage that true excellence thrives when passion fuels endeavor.
                
                <br>                <br>
                
                Four years later, I proudly stand as a graduate holding a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science - proof that pursuing one's passion yields not just success, but profound fulfillment.
